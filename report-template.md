## Overview of the Analysis


In this module linear regression algothrims were deployed to assess the risk of a person applying for loan. The two main algorithims used was predicting a logistic regression model with the original data and with oversampled data. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
 - The healthy loans make up 100% of True Positive predictions as per the 1.00 precision score
 - The healthy loans make up 99% of all Positive predictions as per the 0.99 recall score



* Machine Learning Model 2:
   - The healthy loans make up 99% of True Positive predictions as per the 0.99 precision score
   - The healthy loans make up 99% of all Positive predictions as per the 0.99 recall score
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
The first model works best as the second model returned only 0.99 for all scores. The first model gives a much better insight on how risky a loan will be and is much better for assessing risk as well as predicting future scores.
